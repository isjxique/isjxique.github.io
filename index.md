## About Me

<img class="profile-picture" src="profile_pic.jpeg">

I am a research scientist at MTRI where I develop and implement mathematical models using scientific computing tools to tackle problems involving electromagnetic sensor data. In my free time, I also enjoy building applications for Detriot area organizations with a group of full stack web developers, reading a good book, and hitting the beach.
