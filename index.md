## About Me

<img class="profile-picture" src="profile_pic.jpeg">

During the week, I work as a research scientist at MTRI where I develop and implement mathematical models to measure and improve the performance of systems using RADAR, LIDAR, and optical sensor data. During the weekend, I work with a group of full stack web developers to build applications for Detroit area organizations.
